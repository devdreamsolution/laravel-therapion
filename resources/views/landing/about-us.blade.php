										<p>Our history: 
                                           Our company was founded in 2005. 
                                           In the beginning, we managed various smaller regional websites, 
                                           such as Ulkopsykologit.fi (in Finnish and Swedish)
                                           and Latpsi.com (Psicolog√≠a para Latinos; in Spanish and English).
                                           As the service grew popular, we merged all sites into one in year 2009.
                                           The new site was named Therapion in reference to "therapy". 
                                           Today our services are available in 15 languages, and we 
                                           are present on all continents.
                                           </p>
									
										
										<p>Our Approach: Our approach is to tailor mental health care to each client's individual needs. 
                                           Our approach is non-judgemental and all-inclusive.
                                           We respect human rights and personal choises. 
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
									   Our approach is multi-disciplinary.
                                       In our team you'll find specialists from all major areas of psychology, 
                                       psychotherapy and coaching. Our service covers the most popular
                                       mental health care topics, and it is not limited to any particular area of expertise.

									   <p>
                                       In our approach prevention is as important as actually 
                                       treating mental health care issues. In our opinion 
									   mental health care should be available to all.

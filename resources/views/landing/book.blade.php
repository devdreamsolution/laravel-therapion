We belief that problems are not caused by life events themselves, but how we experience them. Our experience, in turn, will affect and be affected by how we feel about ourselves, influencing self-esteem and confidence. The humanistic approach to counselling therefore encourages the client to learn to understand how negative responses to life events can lead to psychological discomfort. We will aim for self-acceptance of both negative and positive aspects of our characters and personalities, therefore I aim to help clients to explore their own thoughts and feelings and to work out their own solutions to their problems.
